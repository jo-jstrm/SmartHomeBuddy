[![Build](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/SmartHomeBuddy/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/SmartHomeBuddy/actions/workflows/build.yml)

SmartHomeBuddy is a desktop application that allows you to identify smart home devices in your home network.
It is extensible with custom Machine Learning models for classification and provides countermeasures to secure your
home. It aims to be a simple and intuitive application, while also offering an infrastructure for interested
contributors to enhance its functionality to identify, analyze and protect home networks.

### Get Started

Download our latest release and try out the GUI, or use the command line interface under the `device-identifier` folder.
The following shows an example command line invocation for starting the Database and GRPC server
(so that the time series database can be queried and the identifier can receive commands).
