# Auto-Generation of Proto Files

## Script
Please use `compile-proto.sh` to generate the proto files for Typescript as well as Python. There are some quirks to the generation process, especially for Python (see below).
## Folder Structure
The subfolders here mirror the placement of the generated proto files in the shbdeviceidentifier Python package of the device-identifier. Due to the weird behavior of the python grpcio_tools this is necessary to achieve the correct import statements within the autogenerated files. See [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/9575) for a discussion.
