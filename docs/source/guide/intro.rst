SmartHomeBuddy aims to provide insight into the vulnerability of a home network.
There exist methods to identify devices within a network without having access to that network.
Currently, there exists no open source tool that can do this and is easy to use for the average user.
In an effort to raise awareness against such methods and showcase some countermeasures, SmartHomeBuddy aims to close that gap.
Based on user-provided network data, SmartHomeBuddy can simulate such attacks and identify devices within a network.
